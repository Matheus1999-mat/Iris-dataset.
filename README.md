# Iris-dataset.. 
Unsupervised learning algorithm in Python, with KMeans algorithm.

In this project, Iris dataset is used to analyse and predict the category of flowers.

Here, Python Language is used, besides some libraries, such as: Pandas, Seaborn and Sklearn.

Pandas: a libray used to manipulate and analyse data, in tabular form. Some examples are spreadsheets, datasets and dataframes, which can be created.
Furthermore, it's also possible to extract statistical information about the dataframe.

Seaborn: it is a data visualization library. It shows statistical graphics.

Sklearn: it is a library in which machine learning algorithms can be found. Sklearn also contains datasets, which are used to make analysis and predictions.
This project has iris dataset, which has data about flowers, and the task is analyse the category of flowers, based on the previous data. 

This project uses KMeans algorithm, an unsupervised learning algorithm. KMeans evaluates the amount of data and identifies some similarities in it. After that, with these similarities, some clusters are created. Clusters are groups of data that are more similar in their group than other groups. Furthermore, it is selected K centroids, where K is the number of clusters. After that, the distance with smallest distance from each point is calculated. The average of position of all points is the new position of centroid. These steps are done again, until the centroids right position be found.
